# Udacity - Sensor Fusion Nanodegree

This Nanodegree program consists of four core courses:
- Lidar
- Camera
- Radar
- Kalman filters

Each course concludes with a project. 

## [Project 1 - Lidar Obstacle Detection](https://github.com/AntoBongio/Sensor_Fusion_Nanodegree/tree/main/01_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection)

In this project, the main goal is to process a point clouds in order to detect
car and trucks on a narrow street using lidar. The detection pipeline consists
of filtering, segmentation, and clustering methods to extract the bounding
boxes surrounding the target objects. The segmentation and clustering methods
contains my own implmentation of RANSAC, KD-Tree, and Euclidean clustering
algorithms.

## [Project 4 - Radar](https://github.com)

## [Project 5 - Unscented Kalman Filter (Lidar/Radar)](https://github.com)
