# Radar Target Generation and Detection

The radarâ€™s capability to determine the targets at long range with accurate velocity and spatial information make it an important sensor for self driving applications. Additionally, its capability to sense objects in dark and poor weather (rain, fog) conditions also help it cover the domains where LIDAR or camera may fail.
